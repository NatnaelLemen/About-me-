                About Me
            </h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>My name is</b> Natnael Lemen. I am a freshman and this is my first semester at a university. I have taken some general education classes at a college in the past. I have worked three full time summer jobs in the past. I am a computer science major and I am currently interested in making my concentration music technology. I expect to complete school in 2027, or if I wanted my masters later on I would be done with school in 2028 or 2029. My plans for the future is to become a web or game developer.

                My Favorite Vacation
            </h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>My favorite vacation</b> was going to Ethiopia for the first time. The first time I visited Ethiopia was when I was 11 years old. Up to that point, I had never seen my extended family before.

                My Proudest Moment
            </h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>My proudest moment</b> was something that was hard to come up with. I would say that my proudest moment would be creating my first website and personality quiz. It marked the beginning of me going down this path of pursuing computer science.
